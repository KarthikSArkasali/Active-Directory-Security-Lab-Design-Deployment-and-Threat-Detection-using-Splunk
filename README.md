# Active Directory Security: Deployment, Monitoring with Splunk, and Attack Simulation

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to **design, build, and secure a complete Active Directory (AD) environment** in a virtual lab setting. It focuses on hands-on implementation of cybersecurity principles, including:

- **Designing a logical AD architecture** with clearly defined roles and network segmentation
- **Deploying and configuring virtual machines** for endpoint, domain controller, attacker, and log analysis roles
- **Instrumenting Windows systems with Sysmon and Splunk** to generate and collect rich security telemetry
- **Installing and managing Active Directory**, including user and organizational unit setup
- **Simulating real-world attacks** using Kali Linux and Atomic Red Team to test security posture
- **Detecting and analyzing malicious activity in Splunk** using Windows Event IDs and MITRE ATT&CK mappings

This project enhances skills in AD administration, threat detection, SIEM integration, and cybersecurity monitoring in enterprise-like environments.

## üöÄ Step 1: Logical Architecture  
 ![AD Project](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c7c3952-39e0-43cb-be46-573c25a9c8eb)
- Created a high‚Äëlevel diagram in Draw.io showing VM roles, network segments, and Splunk infrastructure.

## üíª Step 2: VM Deployment  
| VM Name      | OS             | Role                   |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------|
| `Target-PC`  | Windows 10     | Endpoint for testing   |
| `AD-Server`  | Windows Server | Domain Controller      |
| `Ubuntu-VM`  | Ubuntu Linux   | Splunk Indexer/Forwarder |
| `Kali-VM`    | Kali Linux     | Attack Platform        |

## üîß Step 3: Sysmon & Splunk Setup  
- **Sysmon** installed on both `Target-PC` and `AD-Server`  
- **Splunk Universal Forwarder** deployed on Windows hosts  
- Verified Splunk Forwarder service was running and sending events  

| VM           | Tool                | Status              |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Target‚ÄëPC    | Sysmon & Splunk UF  | ‚úÖ Forwarder active |
| AD‚ÄëServer    | Sysmon & Splunk UF  | ‚úÖ Forwarder active |

## üèó Step 4: Active Directory Installation  
1. Promoted `AD-Server` to domain controller for `karthik.domain`  
2. Created OUs and test users:  
   - **HR** ‚Üí  `sahanaA`
   - **IT** ‚Üí  `vijayaA` 

### 1. Organizational Unit HR:

## üõ° Step 5: Attack Simulation & Telemetry Analysis  

### 5.1 RDP Brute‚ÄëForce (Kali ‚Üí Target‚ÄëPC)  
- Launched Hydra against RDP on `Target-PC`  
- **Splunk** detected Event ID **4625** (failed logins) and **4624** (successful logins)  

| Event ID | Description               | Count |
|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| 4625     | Failed login attempts     |  49   |
| 4624     | Successful login attempts |   1   |

### 5.2 Atomic Red Team (ART) Testing  
- Installed ART on `Target-PC`  
- Executed tests for:
  - **T1136.001** ‚Äì Create Local Account  
  - **T1059.001** ‚Äì Command & Scripting Interpreter  
  - **PowerShell** activity  

#### 1. Create Local Account (T1136.001)
